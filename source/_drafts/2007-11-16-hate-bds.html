<div class='post'>
I am a one of those developers who uses Borland Developer Studio 2006.
Now I just lost my patience about it.

I have a class with <span style="font-style: italic;">internal</span> method accessors.
I need to publish the interface of this class (eg: make it <span style="font-style: italic;">public</span>).

I don't know better way in BDS to do it except using Replace tool.
So I use this stupid way. I type into Text to find "internal " and Replace with "public ".
I check "Case sensitive" and "Prompt on replace" boxes and use Global scope (entire file).
I click "Replace All" button...

It does prompts me to replace some entries. But after second or third one IDE hangs with 100% CPU.


So I kill it. Tried to do it many times, but my time was just wasted.
I only have to wait while the BDS-crocodile starts and then eats my CPU with no response.

I'll do it by hands... What a shame!

I always thoutgh nowadays IDEs are time savers. I'm wrong.
Its majesty BDS's animal reminds me about having a free IDE (<a href="http://sharpdevelop.com/OpenSource/SD/Default.aspx">SharpDevelop</a>)...</div>
