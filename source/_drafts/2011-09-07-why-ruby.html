Morning! It's interesting I've actually been working with Ruby for 7 years or more than that.<br />
And in the past 7 years I frequently have been asked "Why Ruby?".<br />
Journalists or other programmers or myself have been asking what is that about Ruby that it makes it such an appealing programming language that...<br />
Since I actually learned Ruby back in 2003 I've not truly&nbsp;be bothered to look at another programming language again. I went [clarification needed] against "Learn a new programming language every year".<br />But I've been doing that because I am so contempt with Ruby. And I've sort of had a stock answer for a while which is "Ruby fits my brain like a glove". Which is just sort of this weird sense of saying "there's something magical about Ruby that just makes it wonderful to use".<br />
But I come to realise that it is really [4:09 clarify] too easy. That's not telling anybody anything or teaching anybody anything about what is it that special about Ruby [clarify]. We all want to be here, we all want to work with Ruby.<br />
<br />
So I've started to sort of examine that. Started to examine some of the reasons, the specifics of what it is about the Ruby language and the Ruby community that makes it so special and I want to share those findings with you today. That sounded very scientific, didn't it? It's not actually at all scientific :)<br />
<br />
Why are we interested, why do we care why we like Ruby? I think we should care because if we examine the things that we like in details, we learn something that'll hopefully inform us in ways through picking new technology or for reasoning about why should we stick to Ruby tomorrow or a year from now.<br />Or if another programming language comes up, what is it about that, that could possibly challenge our use of Ruby or teach us something.<br />
So examining that will hopefully make us wiser about what it is what we do and why we do it. And I think that's incredibly important for understanding who you are and what you do. Most of you guys here work with Ruby many, many hours every day. So having just a little bit of understanding of what it is what you do for 8, 10, 12 hours a day I think is a worth [clarify] thing to do.<br />
<br />
So let's go through some of the reasons "Why Ruby?".<br />The first thing that really attracted me to Ruby was features. So when I first saw Ruby I saw a collection of really neat features. And of course on top of all [clarify] was blocks. Blocks is the special and&nbsp;determent&nbsp;[clarify] feature. There are tons of others that are wonderful and obviously it's not just the "blocks". It's sort of the combination of everything that... umh...<br />Ruby doesn't just have one big idea and everything flows from that. Ruby is a collection of many great ideas. Everything from the blocks to the first time I saw "unless". Just the keyword unless was to me kind of a big revelation. Just shifting your thinking about how you write code and wait a minute... That's just exactly the same thing as "if not", but Matz actually cared enough to flit that around and turn it into a keyword. That was sort of like "Wow" - this is turning it into a feature [clarify].<br />
<br />
Now, all of these features, blocks, unless, whatever it is your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;feature, Ruby is all about its utilitarian stuff. All about this "use the best tool for the job" kind of thing... and I started with that because I think in some ways is least important. The features of Ruby, or just a specific one feature is not really what makes us stick around. It's not what causes somebody not to learn another programming language for seven years. I think the whole idea for the best tool for the job is sort of a false notion. It has this pre-text of being objective that you could somehow by looking at a checklist of features or utilitarian use of a language decide ultimately whether one language or another language is the right tool for the job. Which I think is completely&nbsp;utterly&nbsp;false. And I think it's a... sort of fake and naive... evaluation of the tools that we use if we think we can boil it down just to utilitarian functions.<br />
<br />
Now. Moving up the letter.<br />Ruby is about a culture too. One of those cultures is testing. I found it pretty special when I wrote Ruby in 2003 that there was such a focus on testing. That's not like Ruby embedded testing or unit testing or sort of modern testing like that. But there was a culture that really took it in and made it part of the community core. This is what we do. We test software. There is not another way to do it. No, no, no! If you are going to be in this crowd, you are going to test your software. Otherwise, you are not really in yet.<br />That sort of renders the Ruby folks as a special tribe. There is this tribe who cares very deeply about testing. Which is different from other tribes who might sort of have some testing in or&nbsp;occasionally&nbsp;care about testing. We care about testing pretty much all the time. So that makes us kind of special. And I think what's interesting too is we can look at it as a lot of different things. Like the guy with shiny peacock hat (on the slide) - maybe that Cucumber. Sort of very intricate way of testing. And yet he can stay right next to the guy who just has some paint on his face. Maybe that's just TestUnit, but doesn't have to be that complicated; maybe it's just that. Yet we all are in the same tribe because it doesn't really matter. Doesn't really matter&nbsp;whether we use one testing formula or another. What makes Ruby special is that we care&nbsp;intensely&nbsp;about the testing and we can get along if we are not using the same tools because that's the driving fundamental. We care about testing, not the testing tools themselves.<br />
<br />
So that sort of move it higher up the chain of arguments here. We have functional arguments of this is the feature or that feature, this is the best tool for the job, that tool. Now we are up to something that moved beyond just individual level of care and concern into more of a shared function. The whole thing about testing is not that I test. It's that other people test too. So if I used their software and I want to make a patch to it I can run their tests and I can find out that I didn't break something. That eases collaboration. Sort of&nbsp;smooths&nbsp;out all those little bumps that's being in Opens Source collaboration. Just like we have other things like GitHub:&nbsp;smooths&nbsp;out... how easy it is to collaborate. And I think that the spirit of collaboration is at a very high level in Ruby. Because of things like the culture of testing, because of things like GitHub, because of all the other things that we do to&nbsp;concisely&nbsp;care about to make it easier to collaborate.<br />And this is why I think it's important to look at these "Why Why Ruby?". Whys such is that relatively small community is capable of putting so many interesting things. Working on so much interesting code, being on the forefront of so much interesting drives in the software community.<br />
<br />
Third reason (code on slide - 12:05). Hope you can see this code, but doesn't really matter. What matters is when I look at this piece of code there is something to it. I think it's just a beautiful piece of code. It doesn't do anything complex, it's not beautiful in sort&nbsp;revelation,&nbsp;intricate&nbsp;algorithm sort of way. But there is something about details about presentation that appeals to me. There is something about&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;of how Ruby lays out on the screen that is&nbsp;intensely&nbsp;joyful. And I've tried to do sort of "what if and exactly" and the best thing I could arrive at... I look at code that's written and does the same thing as this, but where the spacing as a lough, parentheses around... just doesn't look right. Somehow&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;is so refined so that addition or removal just a set of parentheses can change how I feel about code.<br />Now what I find interesting... this is roughly how I started writing Ruby code long time ago. The code style hasn't change a whole lot. And what's equally interesting is when I look at most other Ruby code it looks pretty similar to something like this. The coding style in Ruby is very monogamist [clarify]. We all care roughly about making code pretty pretty much the same. Much more so than I find in many other programming communities. The sense of shared&nbsp;aesthetic&nbsp;is really strong. And I think it's very strong because there is just something about laying out Ruby code that has inherent set of relations how elements look together that just feels good. It's something like looking at something simple, like the pyramids. Ohh, that a pretty simple form. There's something appealing about that form. What is it about? Hmm, that's just a triangle ... you can't... that's hard to describe. You can describe it with, though... it's not about talking about what it is as what it's not.<br />
When I look at this piece of code, which is Python, I don't get that warm feeling. There's&nbsp;something&nbsp;just off. And we can even break it down. If you start from just a comment line. The fact that they would need to repeat the quote [clarif] 3 times seems a little excessive. Doesn't it? How about like... wouldn't two have done it? How about one if it started right under the class? The fact that there is a space&nbsp;even&nbsp;after the last one... ehh, that doesn't feel quite right either. And doesn't even get into the need [clarify] of it. "def __init__" with double underscores at both sides and this is something I have to write every time. Uhhhh. "Self" being passed around all the time? Yak! The name parameters, especially on the seconds line, being uppercase like that with the equal sign ... write from the key to the value [clarify]. Uhhhh.<br />
It doesn't feel right. And I think it's the same reaction with other Ruby programmers have when they look at something like a piece of Python code. There is something off about it. It doesn't mean it can't be beautiful to other people, I'm sure it is, I hope. But it's not beautiful to us. And I think that's part of what makes that... The Ruby community is so agonist that we&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;the same kind of beauty. Ok.<br />
<br />
Moving further up in the list of reasons. I remember I first time read this quote. I did not ever truly started working with Ruby yet and I read that the sign of the language says that "Ruby is designed to make programmers happy". That for me was a shock. Somebody designed a language who care about something so non-functional, so non-objective as the happiness of programmer using it.<br />
