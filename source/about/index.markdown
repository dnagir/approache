I am a passionate Software Engineer with more than 9 years of professional software development experience striving to understand and help the business.
Loving the *Test Driven Development* and believe it will become the de-facto standard soon-ish.

Even more than all the cool things, I love my wife, Nina, who infinitely supports me in every possible situation and takes care of *The Home*.
She is energetic and loving life person. She is the one without whom I cannot imagine my life.
