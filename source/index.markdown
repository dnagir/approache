{% blockquote Albert Einstein, The known genuis %}
Everything should be made
As simple as possible...
But not simpler
{% endblockquote %}


It's all about passion
==================================================

I believe the software development process can be awesome, the same way as its result - the great art - the product.

Software development is not only a boring process and mechanical work,
it is **the art** of creating **incredible solutions** and producing **great ideas**.

And that's what I'm after.
