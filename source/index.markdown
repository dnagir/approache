It's all about passion
==================================================

I believe the software development process can be excellent, same way as its result - the great art - the product.
Software development is not only a boring process and mechanical work,
it is **the art** of creating **incredible solutions** and producing **great ideas**.

How many times have you seen the solutions that amazed you?
How often do you come up with things that wow others?
And most importantly, what do you **feel** then?
Is that feeling comparable to the unimaginable inventions of **Leonardo da Vinci**?

If you answer **Yes**, then you are probably very passionate about developing new cool things.
I have always been trying to create a perfect solution for all the problems.

Unfortunately there is no such so far.
Nevertheless, I believe it is possible to create excellent and amazing solutions.
And this is what I'm after.
