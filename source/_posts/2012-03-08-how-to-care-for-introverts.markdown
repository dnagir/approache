I've just found an [interesting poster](http://afterwordss.tumblr.com/post/5274763919) that describes how to deal with introverts.

Being an introvert myself I agree with most of the points:

- Respect their **need for privacy**.
- Never embarrass them in **public**.
- Let them observe first in **new situations**.
- Give them **time to think**. Don't demand instant answers.
- **Don't interrupt **them.
- Give them **advance notice** of expected changes in their lives.
- Give them **15 minute warnings** to finish whatever they are doing before calling them to dinner or moving on to the next activity.
- Reprimand them **privately**.
- **Teach** them new skills privately rather than in public.
- Enable them to find **one best friend** who has similar interests and abilities; encourage this relationship even if the friend moves.
- Do not push them to make **lots of friends**.
- **Respect** their introversion. Don't try to remake them into extroverts.

I'm pretty sure it is just a common sense. But it helps when people do know it.
