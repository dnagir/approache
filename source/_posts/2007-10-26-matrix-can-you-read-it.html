I've just read an <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/10/26/Must-resist.-decoding.aspx">article</a>.
Ayende links to this <a href="http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/25/thoughts-for-a-thursday/">message</a> which is just a text represented in binary.
Like in a Matrix :)...

If you want to decode it - you'll find the message interesting... A bit depressing, but I like to think about such kind of things.

<span style="font-size: 55%;">If you are too lazy to decode it... <a href="http://dnagir.googlepages.com/RobConery-decoded.txt" target="_blank">Here it is.</a>

<span style="font-size: 55%;">And <a href="http://dnagir.googlepages.com/Ayende-decoded.txt" target="_blank">here</a> is what Ayende says about it :)
