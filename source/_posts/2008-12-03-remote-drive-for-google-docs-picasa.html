<h2>In the sky</h2>  <p><a href="http://www.gladinet.com">Gladinet</a> allows to use in the sky storage the same way as your local hard drive. <a href="http://www.gladinet.com">Check this out</a>.</p>  <p>It also features with:</p>  <ul>   <li>Remote Access To Multiple PCs </li>    <li>On Demand Sharing With Friends </li>    <li>Remote Desktop Access </li>    <li>Service Redirection </li>    <li>Secure Access </li>    <li>Instantly Available </li>    <li>On Demand Share </li>    <li>Native OS Support </li>    <li>Secure Access </li>    <li>Aggregates All My Favorites </li>    <li>Access From Web Browser </li>    <li>Gladinet Web Directory </li> </ul>  <p>Looks impressive and for now it's free. not sure what will happen after the Preview period. Here is the snippet from license:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>There are no fees for the Product offered to You <strong>during the Preview period</strong>. Gladinet reserves the right to institute new charges for access to or use of the Product at any time upon not less than thirty (30) days' notice to You.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Also what about privacy? They say:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>If we use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then <strong>we will ask for your consent</strong> prior to such use.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Ok. I believe that and that's fine with me. And also they seem to be very reasonable in their terms and privacy. For example:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Policy <strong>without your explicit consent</strong>, and we expect most such changes will be minor.</p> </blockquote>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>So looks very good and promising. But I expect it will become a paid service. If the price will be reasonable I'd probably pay for that.</p>  <p></p>  <hr />  <p></p>  <h2>First Experience</h2>  <p>After installation it could start because of port 80 is busy (IIS). Then it give helpful suggestion how to solve the issue: We have to change the port in IIS <strong>or</strong> explicitly set IP address to listen to. I choose 2nd option of course. But we also need to disable Socket Pooling.</p>  <p>After I have followed detailed instructions everything started to work.</p>  <p>Next observation is that Standalone version doesn't require a login, standard does. So I wanted to register there but it seems the account at Forum and the application is not the same (I need to have 2 accounts). But I couldn't just register - I have to wait for the invitation. Unlucky.</p>  <p>Let's get back to the standalone version.</p>  </div>

I'm not sure about this. For me it seem that "ask for your consent" should sound like "notify you".<BR/>But anyway we'll (at least) be notified and we will know what they are going to do. So at least we can perform appropriate actions.</div>

"ask for your consent" is not the same as "obtain your consent".<BR/><BR/>Legally they only have to ask before continuing, and don't need to consider your reply :-)</div>
