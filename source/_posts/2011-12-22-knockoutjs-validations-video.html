If you wonder how you can use KnockoutJS with Rails in a similar way to Backbone.js or Spine.js then <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJzQl-bpmUI">watch the video</a>. It also shows how easy it is to apply client side validations that work alongsite with the server-side validations.<br />
<br />

Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/knockout-rails">knockout-rails</a> project for more details.

This is actually <a href="https://gist.github.com/9ca5dce0524927d69655" rel="nofollow">one of the options</a> of validating in the background: <br /><br />It doesn&#39;t include the bindings, but gives idea how it can be done. Easier than I thought actually.</div>

Pre-validating on the server can technically be done with the Model Events. But it&#39;s not supported out of the box.<br /><br />It is a good idea, but there&#39;s a bit more complexity involved on both client and server. But I&#39;ll gladly accept pull requests to knockout-rails if somebody needs to support that.</div>
