If you are not living under the rock, you must know a lot of buzzing around HTML5 and CSS3.<br />
And if you want to keep up with technologies so that you won’t become a grand daddy saying “I work with HTML1 and no CSS which works on all browsers”, then you DO HAVE to learn HTML5.<br />
And there is one more opportunity for that, a great book from the great publisher (PragProg):<br />
<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/bhh5/html5-and-css3" target="_blank">HTML5 and CSS3: Develop with Tomorrow's Standards Today</a><br />
Looking at the excerpts, I do like it for now and will get it as soon as I will have finished some of my other readings.</div>
