<div class='post'>
After you need your application to be localized for many lnguages you can decide what ResourceManager to use, where to store resource and many other things.

But where from to start localazing the application?

I calculate a good starting point using <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/Team/FxCop/">FxCop</a>.
This will allow to achive a few goals:
<br />
<ol>
<li>Detect non-localized strings in code.</li>
<li>Fix formatting issues.</li>
<li>Fix some very simple spelling errors (but still good).</li>
</ol>
To strat doing the things you need to analize your assembly(s) then go to <i>Rules</i> tab. Select <i>Globalization Rules</i>.<br />
This is a good starting point for localazing the application.</div>
