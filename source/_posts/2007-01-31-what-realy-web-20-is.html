<span style="font-weight: bold;">Key Principles
</span></a></span>In the opening talk of the first <a href="http://www.web2con.com/">web 2.0 conference</a>, Tim Oâ€™Reily and John Battelle summarized key principles of web 2.0 applications:              <br />
<ol>
<li>Web as platform, reach out to the entire web not just the center.
</li>
<li>Harnessing collective intelligence, turning the web into a kind of global brain.
</li>
<li>Data is the next Intel inside.
</li>
<li>End of Software release cycle, i.e. Operations must become a core competency and Users must be treated as co-developers, in a reflection of open source development practices.
</li>
<li>Lightweight programming models to build loosely coupled systems and allow syndication.
</li>
<li>Software above the level of a single device i.e. not limited to any specific platform, technology and devices.
</li>
<li>Rich user experience i.e. enabling user to use web as a medium to collaborate, classify and editing etc.</li>
</ol>
