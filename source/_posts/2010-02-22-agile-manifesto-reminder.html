<div class='post'>
Just a reminder about the agile <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/" target="_blank">manifesto</a>. The purpose of this post is to read and write all that again and keep in mind <b>both left and right</b> parts of it. Just remember to<br />
<blockquote>
value in the items on the right, â€¦ value the items on the left more</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><b>Individuals and interactions</b> over processes and tools</li>
<li><b>Working software</b> over comprehensive documentation</li>
<li><b>Customer collaboration</b> over contract negotiation</li>
<li><b>Responding to change</b> over following a plan</li>
</ul>
This all especially comes to mind after reading Ayende's <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2010/02/20/nice-process-but-what-about-the-engineering-bits.aspx" target="_blank">post</a> about ignoring the actual building of the software.</div>
