<div class='post'>
Today I was looking for a compact and fast CSV reader and found one.
It satisfies all my requirements.

But when I was reading comments some guy had a problem and didn't know what to do with it.
Ready? He wrote following:
<span style="color: #660000; font-family: verdana; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-family: arial;">I downloaded the .NET 2.0 demo version, and it won't run because it is looking for a </span><span style="font-family: arial; font-weight: bold;">namespace called NUnit</span>.</span>

The author is a really good guy - he politely answered to add reference to NUnit or remove NUnit project from solution.

I was laughing some minutes of this. Are there people (developers) in the world who don't know about xUnit?

Or maybe he is just not a developer... Or maybe he's just having fun asking it...
There can be some excuses for him. But anyway it was very funny for me to see such kind of a question.</div>
