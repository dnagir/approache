<div class='post'>
One of the easiest and best <a href="http://apirocks.com/html5/html5.html">presentations about HTML5</a>.<br />
Just must see thing.<br />
<br />
What I like about it is that it:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>is actually a simple HTML5 web site;</li>
<li>describes most notable features of HTML5 AND</li>
<li>allow to see the features in action (provided that you browser supports HTML5).</li>
</ul>
<div>
<br /></div>
<br />
<br /></div>
