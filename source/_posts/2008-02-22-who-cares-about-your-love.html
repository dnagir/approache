<p>How distance can change your life?  
Have you ever thought about it? Have you ever had a long time without the only one person you can imagine your life with?</p>  <p>I have had. What should you do if you are in a doubt if you really are in love? What actually is your love? Should the love be one way street?</p>  <p><img src="http://lh4.google.com/dnagir/RvY6xdF8D2I/AAAAAAAAB8c/RQprqHcAz2A/DSC07733.JPG" align="left" height="210" width="279" /> There are so many points I have believed in so much and there are so many disappointments in my life.   
How can you regret about the things you have previously been very confident in?   
How can you imagine your life if all of your ideals are broken to the ground and might never recover?</p>  <p>How many people live with the true, honest love? The love from the deep inside.  
How many people live with a "love" by an occasion. The "love" of a habit.</p>  <p>Can you say you are going to be happy with your spouse every moment of your life and during all the life?</p>  <p> </p>  <p>There are so many questions... And there are so little answers...</p>  <p> </p>  <p>But the most important thing is... </p>  <p>Are you ready to break everything for a better future of everybody? Are you ready to suffer to make people you really love more happy?</p>  <p>That is a really big deal.<img src="http://www.basehead.org/files/shots/1-broken_heart.jpg" align="right" height="205" width="274" /></p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>You're once a dream that came true      
an illusion that turned to reality       
but suddenly, things turned differently       
the way they used to be       
until such time i have no choice but to let you go</strong></p>    <p><strong>you're the reason for my sleepless nights      
coz you keep stayin' on my mind       
i can't help myself from crying       
coz i'm missing you so much...</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>What do people need to come to the idea they are not "suitable" for each other?  
Maybe just live separate and just get real is enough? Probably there are tons of other reasons. But who cares if you already are on this stage. It seems like everything you truly believed in doesn't make sense anymore.</p>  <p>Who can recover from it? Who can forget the first touches to the girlfriend, first kisses, first sayings... Everything first....  
I have always believed in first-and-last love. It is hard to accept everything you believed in is not true anymore. It doesn't matter whom you have "known" before. It only matters who is the first and the last.</p>  <blockquote>   <p><strong>I thought I finally received a break      
Only to see the sun fall </strong></p>    <p><strong>My eyes will not see what they longed to see      
My lips will not taste what they longed to taste </strong></p>    <p><strong>Why does life have to be like this      
Full of hatred and pain       
Instead of joy and bliss</strong></p> </blockquote>  <p>There is only one thing I want to say by this. If you are happy - never ever try get rid of it.  
The happiness (in any of its development) is not supposed to be broken. It's a God's bless. So just take care of it. Grow it and care.</p></div>

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no records of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always preseveres. Love never fails.</div>
