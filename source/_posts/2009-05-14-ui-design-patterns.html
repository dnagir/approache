That&#39;s a really good site. And it is really good idea to use common patterns for UI, as people get used to common patterns. <br /><br />Students on the IT faculty on 4 learning year compose top links menu on site separated by  &#39;&gt;&gt;&#39; symbol. <br /><br />And I spent 30 mins trying to make them understand that if you use &gt;&gt; this is not a menu, but breadcrumbs.</div>
