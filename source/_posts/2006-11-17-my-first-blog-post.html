<div class='post'>
I've seen many times different bloggers but never was ready to start blogging at any.
It seems for me that <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">blogger.com</a> is most easy-to-use and feature full.
I like a lot that it integrates with my <a href="http://google.com/">Google </a>account.


I really want to find some time for blogging...
Let's see if I'll keep my blog up to date...</div>
