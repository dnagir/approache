A while ago I wrote about <a href="http://blog.approache.com/2010/02/agile-manifesto-reminder.html">agile manifesto</a> everybody should keep in mind (when they claim to be agily-ish). Now I want to quote the principle of the Agile. This is another reminder for my after reading the great book - <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/news/the-agile-samurai">The Agile Samurai</a>. Highly recommend it.<br />
So here <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">they are</a>:<br />
<ol>
<li>Our highest priority is to <b>satisfy the customer       </b>through <b>early and continuous delivery</b>      <br />of valuable software.</li>
<li><b>Welcome changing requirements</b>, even late in      <br />development. Agile processes harness change for      <br />the customer's competitive advantage.</li>
<li><b>Deliver working software frequently</b>, from a      <br />couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a      <br />preference to the shorter timescale.</li>
<li>Business people and developers must <b>work       <br />together </b>daily throughout the project.</li>
<li>Build projects around <b>motivated individuals</b>.      <br />Give them the environment and support they need,      <br />and <b>trust them </b>to get the job done.</li>
<li>The most efficient and effective method of     <br />conveying information to and within a development      <br />team is <b>face-to-face conversation</b>.</li>
<li><b>Working software</b> is the primary <b>measure of progress</b>.</li>
<li>Agile processes promote <b>sustainable development</b>.      <br />The sponsors, developers, and users should be able      <br />to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.</li>
<li><b>Continuous</b> attention to <b>technical excellence</b>      <br />and good design enhances agility.</li>
<li><b>Simplicity</b> - the art of maximizing the amount      <br />of work not done - is essential.</li>
<li>The best architectures, requirements, and designs     <br />emerge from <b>self-organizing teams</b>.</li>
<li>At regular intervals, the team reflects on how     <br />to <b>become more effective</b>, then tunes and adjusts      <br />its behavior accordingly.</li>
