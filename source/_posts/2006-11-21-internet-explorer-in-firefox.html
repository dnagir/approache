<div class='post'>
I often use Firefox beside my IE (currently version 6 and 7) during my development.
Very often I need to test some page in both IE and Firefox. So I need to keep both browsers open together. But after I found very nice add-on for Firefox this is not the case anymore.
<a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/1419/">Here</a> it is.
This allows to switch browser at runtime when Firefox is open.
Woulld be good to have something like for IE too.
Or maybe it already exists?</div>
