I never knew that. But it <a href="http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2008/12/23/hidden-windows-gems-extensible-storage-engine.aspx" target="_blank">seems</a> Windows has an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms684493%28VS.85%29.aspx" target="_blank">Embed database</a> with it which sounds really interesting (no more MsSqlExpress, FireBird etc).<br />
It also has a .NET interface at <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/ManagedEsent" target="_blank">CodePlex</a>.<br />
This sounds interesting, but I'm not sure how reliable it is and what are the exact features (bugs) of it.<br />
Also when most of the O/R-mapping tools will start supporting it (the ESENT API has already been published for years).<br />
Anyway, I'll need to have a look at this type of DB but I'm a bit skeptical about using it in a real .NET project.</div>
