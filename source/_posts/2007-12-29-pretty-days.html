I have just heard <a href="http://www.westegg.com/nash/halcyon.html">Pretty Days by Ogden Nash</a> and like the words.
People sometimes just need to be nowhere and think about nothing.
Or maybe something infinite...

Anyway read these lines and do your best to enjoy the New Year.

<blockquote>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">How pleasant to sit on the beach,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">On the beach, on the sand, in the sun,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">With ocean galore within reach,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">And nothing at all to be done!</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No letters to answer,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No bills to be burned,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No work to be shirked,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">No cash to be earned,</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">It is pleasant to sit on the beach</span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">With nothing at all to be done!</span></blockquote></div>

Your preference for Nash is admirable and I've noted in a post on <A HREF="http://blog.ogdennash.org/2007/12/enthralled-about-nothing.html" REL="nofollow">Blogden Nash</A> where I report on the reach and influence of Ogden Nash on contemporary life.<BR/><BR/>Cheers!<BR/><BR/>John</div>
