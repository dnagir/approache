<p>There are so many cases when we need to put content from MS Word to a web page or CMS system. Word gives very specific HTML with its own formatting, styles etc and there's no way for Rich Text editors (like tyniMCE, FCKEditor...) to pick it and handle correctly. It never looks good.</p>  <p>But there's a little known feature in Word: press <strong><em>Ctrl-Space</em></strong> and you'll get very good HTML. This is just a real time saver.</p>  </div>
