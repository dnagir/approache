<blockquote>
<a href="http://sm-art.biz/Ivonna.aspx" target="_blank">Ivonna</a> is an Asp.Net testing tool that allows writing unit tests for your Asp.Net applications. What makes it different is that Ivonna runs in the same process as the test runner.</blockquote>
The tool has 21 day fully functional trial period. It tightly relies on <a href="http://www.typemock.com/" target="_blank">TypeMock</a> (you should even buy it from there).<br />
Might be worth to check it out.</div>
