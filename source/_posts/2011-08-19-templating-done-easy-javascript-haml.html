<h3>
HAML templating with no worries: native, precompiled HAML. Blazing fast and as easy to use as it can be. </h3>

<strong>
<em>UPDATE: this functionality moved into <a href='https://github.com/dnagir/ruby-haml-js'>ruby-haml-js</a> gem, please use it instead.</em>

Recently I have been working on a Ruby gem that packs a set of common JavaScript libraries in one place so you can just reference those easily from <b>Rails 3.1</b> app.  But now I want to write a bit about a very handy tool that the gem includes.  I needed to work on a <a href='http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone'>Backbone</a> app and, unfortunately, there was no very simple and easy way of using HAML markup for my client side templates. Main problems: <ol>
<li>I don't want to <b>embed</b> the template into the document.</li>
<li>The Underscore.js templating is ok, but it is <b>too verbose</b> for me (as most of others).</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/creationix/haml-js">haml-js</a> is great, but I do not want to bother <b>precompiling</b> the templates.</li>
<li>I do not want to think about templating as another layer or component. I want it to <b>just work</b>.</li>
</ol>

<div>
Fortunately it was pretty easy solve these <em>problems</em> with the <a href="https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets">Sprockets</a> and Rails 3.1.
</div>

<div>
So from now on you can just write normal HAML templates and consume those with no worries from JavaScript.
</div>

<div>
All you need to do, is to add <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/pakunok">pakunok</a> gem to your Rails 3.1 Gemfile.  This will give you templates as <b>native JavaScript functions</b> that you can use.
