<p>My old good friend sent me a small <a href="http://www.borrett.id.au/computing/petals-bg.htm" target="_blank">riddle</a> yesterday. Honestly saying after couple of minutes I was ready to give up.</p>  <p>But then something clicked: <em>the name of the game is important</em>. And I had seen the answer.</p>  <p>Anyway I decided to repeat it and implement it for everybody's pleasure.</p>  <p>Basically you have some dices on the desk and should guess (calculate) the number. The most important thing are:</p>  <ol>   <li>The name of the game is <em>Petals Around the Rose</em>. </li>    <li>The answer is always even. </li>    <li>The answer is always available for any particular throw. </li> </ol>  <p>Train yourself with my online dices-desk.</p> <iframe style="border-top-width: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; margin: 0px; width: 100%; padding-top: 0px; border-right-width: 0px" src="http://dnagir.googlepages.com/PetalsAroundTheRose.htm" noresize="noresize" scrolling="no" height="300" allowtransparency="allowtransparency"> </iframe>  </div>
