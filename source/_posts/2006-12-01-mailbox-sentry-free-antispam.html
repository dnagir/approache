I've discovered very good antispam system which gives full control over your mail boxes. If you want you can manually list all mails and choose what is spam and what is not. You can let the program make decision. Very nice feature - "<a href="http://www.sentry.com.ru/eng/index.htm#description">challenge/response</a>". Also I must mention here that it requires very litle of system resources. Very good job.
One more interesting thing that it is developed in Ukraine by Mykhaylo Makarkin. This means very good quality of the product.
It's time to go to his site: <a href="http://www.sentry.com.ru/eng/index.htm">English version</a>, <a href="http://www.sentry.com.ru">Russian Version</a>.</div>
