<p>The Ruby developers know and hear a lot of buzz about RSpec BDD framework. The RSpec specifications code is so easy to read, but for my it is often hard to write. So I intend to produce a small cheat-sheet for RSpec syntax for myself.</p>  <p>Most of it come from the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book">RSpec Book</a> in rather unusual way. As a RSpec itself (unfortunately not runnable for now).</p>  <p>Please feel free to use it in any way you want and correct the mistakes.</p>  <p>So <a href="https://gist.github.com/663876">here we go</a>:</p> <script src="https://gist.github.com/663876.js?file=rspec-syntax-cheat-sheet.rb"></script>  </div>
