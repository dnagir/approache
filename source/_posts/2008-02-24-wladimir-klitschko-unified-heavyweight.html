<p></p>  <p><img src="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/44447000/jpg/_44447366_wladimir203.jpg" align="left" />Today (February 23, 2008), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wladimir_Klitschko" target="_blank">Wladimir Klitschko</a> defeated WBO heavyweight champion <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultan_Ibragimov" target="_blank">Sultan Ibragimov</a> at Madison Square Garden in New York City to win the undisputed heavyweight championship. </p>  <p><img height="212" src="http://cache.viewimages.com/xc/55766151.jpg?v=1&amp;c=ViewImages&amp;k=2&amp;d=780858ABC91EC21430100FEBDB6434D8A40A659CEC4C8CB6" width="177" align="right" />The <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/boxing/7242096.stm" target="_blank">fight</a> was fully under the control of Wladimir. He did not finish it with knock-out, but showed total &quot;ownership&quot; of the ring.</p>  <p> The Klitschko-Ibragimov fight was the first heavyweight unification since Holyfield-Lewis in 1999.</p>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>The Klitschko brothers are not just good boxers, punchers, real fighters. They are probably the most intelligent boxers of all times and all around the world. They never &quot;black mouth&quot;, they respect their rivals, they respect people. And they are respected as well.</p>  <p>I am very proud of Wladimir who is a good sample of intelligence, strength, respect.</p>  </div>
