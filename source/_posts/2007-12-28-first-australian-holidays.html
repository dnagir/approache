Christmas has gone some days ago, New Year will be at our doors in some days.
I am now having my season holidays on the <a href="http://www.goldcoast.qld.gov.au/">Gold Coast</a> in Queensland.
</p>

Very interesting and also tiresome thing is that we were driving from Melbourne to Gold Cost.
It's a very long distance and it took us 2 days to get there. On the way we met friends in Sydney and took some relax.
I was very glad when we had arrived to our apartments. I could fall asleep for a very long time. I just like sleeping :)
Here are some photos: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dnagir/GoldCoastOnTheWay">Gold Coast - on the way</a>.

After some lazzy, realy lazzy days there I, at last, went for a walk around Broadbeach and Surfers Paradise. I found there Australian Shooting Academy (ASA) and decided to try small Magnum pistol. I put some of the photos into <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dnagir/GoldCoastMisc">this album</a>.

And finally today I have been in the <a href="http://seaworld.myfun.com.au/">Sea World</a> - very nice and beautiful place. I was trying to shoot dolphins on the fly with my old K750 phone and it seems i succeeded. I couldn't believe it. There are some amazing photos with dolphins. Have a look <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/dnagir/GoldCoastSeaWorld">here</a>.

Now waiting for a New Year and will see if I'll take some more good shoots with my camera...
This place is really kind of paradise...
But I miss so much here one beautiful, lovely and loved person. If Nina could only be here with me... This would be a real paradise.
