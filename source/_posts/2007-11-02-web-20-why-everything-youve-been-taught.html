<div class='post'>
I had been watching some videos from <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">YUI Theater</a>. A lot of interesting stuff is there about client-side and front-end web development.

Must see videos are from <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=111593">Douglas Crockford — "The JavaScript Programming Language"</a> (see all the 4 parts there).

But I really like one from from Joseph Smarr — <a href="http://video.yahoo.com/video/play?vid=1041101">High-performance JavaScript: Why Everything You've Been Taught Is Wrong</a>.
He gives overview of a real-world Web 2.0 web application (<a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo</a>) and explains that many things that are in general a good practice (including patterns) are not always good. Just because of the performance.

Joseph says he met a guy who was so proud that he applied all of the patterns (that he knows?). But was there a need of it? Maybe yes, maybe not. But:

<span style="font-weight: bold;">Always think about performance, from the beginning to the end.</span>
