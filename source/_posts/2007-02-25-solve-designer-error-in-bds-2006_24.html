<div class='post'>
Many of developers working with ASP.NET in design time saw the error: "<i><b>The designer could not be shown for this file because none of the classes within it can be designed</b></i>".

I happens in Visual Studio and in Borland Developer Studio when a web page is inherited from some base class and not from default Page.

Common actions to solve it are:
<br />
<ol>
<li>Add public default constructor to base class.</li>
<li>Add private InitializaComponent method to base.</li>
<li>Call InitializaComponent from the default constructor.</li>
</ol>
But in BDS there're some more issues.<br />
Even after these steps it can still show the error. After I played with that I found that this error appears in following situation:<br />
<ol>
<li>Open web project.</li>
<li>Default page is opening in design mode.</li>
<li>If it has errors no one page that is inherited from some base class will open anymore.</li>
</ol>
<i><span style="font-size: 85%;">Tho note: if base class will be changed to default one (Page), than designer successfully appears.</span></i><br />
So, in a short, to make BDS working with base class in design time one of solutions is needed:<br />
<ul>
<li>Add constructor, InitializaComponent method to base class. Then inherit default page from standard Page class. Other web forms should successfuly be available in designer.</li>
<li>If designer is required, temporary inherit from standard Page class.</li>
</ul>
That's what I found.</div>
