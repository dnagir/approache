<p>
In my <a href="http://blog.approache.com/2011/05/setting-up-ubuntu-1104-server-for-rails.html">previous post</a> I provided some info about setting up the server for rails app.

</p>

<p>
Now I am going to describe the Nginx configuration and example of Capistrano deployment file.
</p>

<p>
One thing that I don't want to do for every new app I deploy is to go to the web server and change the settings (as a root user) so that the web server picks the Rails application.
</p>

<p>
In order to avoid that I decided to use nginx's <a href="http://wiki.nginx.org/CoreModule#include">include</a> command. It allows to add include multiple nginx config files using UNIX wildcards.
</p>

<p>
So by simply adding this line to the nginx.config I make it possible to configure Nginx from Rails applicatoins themselves:
<code>include /home/*/apps/*/current/nginx.conf;</code>.

I decided to include all configs within <code>http</code> tag so that a Rails app can configure multiple servers for itself.
</p>

<p>
There are obvious drawbacks for this:

<ol>
<li>It is less "safe" as on application might affect others if you will start adding Nginx settings outside of the <code>server</code> tag. But I am ready to sacrifice this for the sake of having more flexibility by assuming all server citizens are good guys.</li>
<li>We still need to have root access to restart the Nginx. We shouldn't need to do it often, so that's ok with me.</li>
</ol>

Now relying on a very simple conventions, I can configure Nginx from within the app. Just in case you've missed it, the conventions are:

<ol>
<li>To deploy a rails app (and any Rack based app), user should put the app under his home directory in <code>apps/[name]/current</code>.</li>
<li>To "enable" an app, user should put <code>nginx.conf</code> file in <code>apps/[name]/current</code>.</li></ol>

</p>


<p>
But for now, all this cool structure isn't very helpful unless we deploy the app.
</p>

<p>
I went with the Ruby de-facto deployment tool - Capistrano. There are enough resources on the net on how to "Capify" your application, so I won't go into details. I assume you have just done <code>capify .</code> and understand what is going in there.
</p>

<p>
Briefly, what I need to do is following:

<ol>
<li>Deploy the app explicitly to a particular domain (staging, production, local server etc).</li>
<li>On every deployment - backup SQLite database (I know, I'll use something better when I'll have 1 million users).</li>
<li>Prepare Nginx config file for the server (it depends on the domain we deploy at).</li>
<li>Pre-Compile assets (SCSS in my case).</li>
</ol>

</p>

<p>
So grab <a href="https://gist.github.com/978737">the gist</a> (embedded below) with all the details and let me know what can be improved there. The usage is pretty simple: 
</p>

<p>
<code>cap deploy user=dnagir domain=connecty.approache.com</code>
</br />
You can deploy the same app multiple times to the same server with different subdomains and they will not conflict:
<br />

<code>cap deploy user=dnagir domain=staging.connecty.approache.com</code>
<br />
<code>cap deploy user=dnagir domain=demo.connecty.approache.com</code>

</p>

<p>
The most interesting I think is that the <code>nginx.conf</code> file is created during deployment using default Ruby templating engine and transfered over to the right location on the server. (But still remember root-ed Nginx restart is still required).
</p>

<p>You can look at the complete source in the <a href="https://github.com/dnagir/connecty/tree/bdd10b8e2bcd946a62cc66075d87ac107e513305">Connecty project</a> at Github.
</p>

<p>Please feel free to tell me what you think about this process.</p>
