Hi Alex,<br /><br />Thanks for that. I'm aware of that. But had to mention that I'm not looking for server-side specific library. Instead I want it to be platform independent. Or at the very bad end - .NET specific :)<br /><br />Another thing is that I really had to include MootTools. But, honestly, for me the choice is between jQuery and YUI at this stage.<br /><br />I had enough licensing problems with ExtJS and I don't want to deal with it again.<br /><br />Cheers.</div>

Well, you have forgot Google Web Toolkit (http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) and MooTools (http://mootools.net/) <br /><br />First one is really coooool for large javascript projects - it performs some optimizations during java2js compilation, and second one is one used by some people for small projects well. <br /><br />By the way ,there's analog of extjs built for google web tookit. Here's their demo: http://extjs.com/explorer/<br /><br />It is called ext-gwt</div>
