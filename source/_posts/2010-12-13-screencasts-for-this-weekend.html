<p>This weekend I was watching the screencasts instead of Sunday movies. It left me with a lot of inspiration and impressions. So I thought I would share the stuff you might also be interested in:</p>  <ol>   <li><a href="http://tekpub.com/conferences/ndc2010/aspnet-mvc-vs-ruby-on-rails---the-net-rocks-smackdown">ASP.NET MVC vs Ruby on Rails - The .NET Rocks Smackdown</a></li>    <li><a href="http://tekpub.com/conferences/rubyconf2010/dhh">Why Ruby?</a></li>    <li><a href="http://tekpub.com/conferences/ndc2010/testing-csharp-and-aspnet-applications-with-ruby">Testing C# and ASP.NET Applications with Ruby</a></li>    <li><a href="http://tekpub.com/conferences/ndc2010/ruby-for-net-developers">Ruby for .NET developers</a> (Scott Belware is awesome BTW)</li>    <li><a href="http://tekpub.com/conferences/ndc2010/riding-ironruby-on-rails">Riding IronRuby On Rails</a></li> </ol>  <p>&#160;</p>  <p>Other things are:</p>  <ol>   <li><a title="http://tekpub.com/conferences/ndc2010/monotouch-deep-dive" href="http://tekpub.com/conferences/ndc2010/monotouch-deep-dive">MonoTouch DeepDive</a></li>    <li><a href="http://peepcode.com/pages/rails-3-screencasts">Meet Rails 3</a> by PeepCode (a producer of high-quality screencasts)</li> </ol>  <p>I think if you are a software engineer with open mind then you do need to watch some of the videos. This is especially true if you are a .NET developer who wants to explore other areas and technologies.</p>  </div>
