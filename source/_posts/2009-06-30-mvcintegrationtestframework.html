Have a look at the interesting topic: <a href="http://blog.codeville.net/2009/06/11/integration-testing-your-aspnet-mvc-application/" target="_blank">Integration Testing Your ASP.NET MVC Application</a>.<br />
Not sure how mature all the stuff is but it’s definitely the thing I was missing in ASP.NET for a long time.<br />
We’ll see if I have a chance to try it.</div>
