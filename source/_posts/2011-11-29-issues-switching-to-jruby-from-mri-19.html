<b>UDPATE</b>: The reason for switching to JRuby the native neo4j API. Have to use REST API with MRI.<br />
<br />
This is just a quick recap of what issues I have had trying to switch existing app from MRI Ruby (1.9.3) to JRuby (1.6.4).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I stepped back and didn't want to spend more time as it felt an unbreakable chain of issues. Resolving one, you think "huh, awesome". But very soon you hit the next.<br />
And I couldn't see it stopping.<br />
<br />
<b>But PLEASE bear in mind</b> that I only spent a couple of hours on that. With a little bit more persistence, you may be able to the end of the tunnel.<br />
<br />
The overall impression is that it is not a big deal really. The problems arise when trying to use other libraries. And unfortunately, not all of the gems <b>care deep enough to support JRuby</b>. And this is the biggest issue in my opinion, there are very little issues with JRuby itself. The transition (from the syntax perspective) was extremely easy.<br />
<br />
The application is pretty standard Rails 3.1 app that uses gems like Dragonfly, inherited_resources, cancan, paper_trail, Authlogic, CoffeeScript, Haml, Sass, Formtastic etc. For testing - things like rspec-rails, cucumber-rails, capybara-webkit, guard (rspec and cucumber), database_cleaner etc.<br />
<br />
So here is a quick list of the things that I faced on my way.<br />
<br />
Before everything else I enabled support for 1.9 syntax in JRuby (export JRUBY_OPTS=--1.9).<br />
<br />
It all first started with <a href="https://gist.github.com/1402753">the weird issue</a> where the <b>wrong arguments were passed to RSpec shared example</b>.<br />
Unfortunately I did not figure out why it happened and just patched it as you can see in the comments there.<br />

</script>

<br />
<br />
<br />
After fixing this issue I had another one related to <b>database_cleaner</b>. So I ended up with a <a href="https://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner/pull/83">pull request</a> that worked for me.<br />
<br />
The other issue was a<b> huge stack trace</b>. I scrolled 3 pages in the terminal to get to the top. Most of that stack trace is deep inside Java. Additionally I got <b>wrong line number</b> on exception. This "features/step_definitions/company_steps.rb:234" makes me thing that the exception is at line 234. But that file only had 49 lines of code. Now, go figure.<br />
<br />
Going on... <a href="https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov">SimpleCov</a> gem didn't work out of the box and gave the warning that I need to enable debugging. That's fine and understandable. But after half an hour of debugging of unrelated exception, it turned out that <b>SimpleCove threw an exception</b> because of that. So had to go and explicitly disable it.<br />
<br />
Then I managed to run all of my specs. But I was pretty surprised how <b>slow</b> it was:<br />
<pre><code>
# rvm use 1.9.3
# time rspec # real=14s, rspec time ~ 12s

# rvm use jruby
# time rspec # real=52s, rspec time ~ 30s

</code>
</pre>
But this is expected as JRuby doesn't have enough time to optimise here. It should be much better in production. But it will be also shit slow after deployment.<br />
Ok. That's fine. <b>I can trust it's fast</b>.<br />
<br />
Then I tried running the cucumber specs and had to file the <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-6237">issue</a> to support <b>new Ruby 1.9.3 syntax</b> (a = b = f 1). Not a big deal, easily fixed with parens: a = b = f(1).<br />
<br />
Next and the <b>final issue</b> - I could not run the <b>headless cucumber specs</b> (capybara-webkit). It just got stuck (no CPU used) and feels like there is a <b>dead-lock</b> or something similar.<br />
<br />
I couldn't see way of fixing it easily and decided that for now I am <b>done with</b> it. So going <b>back to Ruby 1.9.3</b>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>To summarise</b>, I <b>did not feel like it's a problem</b> to switch to JRuby. But it's really a <b>big deal to actually use</b> it due to the number of <b>C extensions</b> that JRuby doesn't really support.<br />
<br />
Again, to emphasise, there is nothing horribly wrong with JRuby and it seems to be pretty good. But the real showstoppers are the C extensions.</div></div>

Totally with you on this. But real world seems to be a bit different :)</div>

Yet another reason to avoid C-extensions. When selecting dependencies for a new project, I prefer to select pure-Ruby libraries or FFI bindings (https://github.com/ffi/ffi#readme). Pure-Ruby libraries should be faster on Rubinius/JRuby. FFI bindings work perfectly on both MRI and JRuby.<br /><br />If developers want faster Ruby code, they should help make MRI faster (or switch to Rubinius/JRuby), instead of writing more code in C.</div>
