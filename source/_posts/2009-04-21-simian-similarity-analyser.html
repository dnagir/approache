<p>A new tool that I’ve discovered: “<em><strong>Simian can be used on any human readable files such as ini files, deployment descriptors, you name it.</strong></em>”</p>  <p><a title="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/products/simian/" href="http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/products/simian/">http://www.redhillconsulting.com.au/products/simian/</a></p>  <blockquote>   <p>Simian catches these and other instances of duplication [as described on the original page] and can be configured to either flag them as warnings or even <i>&quot;break the build&quot;</i>, ensuring that copy and pasting never again causes you or your project problems.</p></blockquote>  </div>
