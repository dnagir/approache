<p></p>  <p>I like the words below from Ogden Nash. Just want to share it.</p>  <p>Always Marry An April Girl</p>  <blockquote>   <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Praise the spells and bless the charms,     </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I found April in my arms.      </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">April golden, April cloudy,      </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;      </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">April soft in flowered languor,      </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">April cold with sudden anger,      </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Ever changing, ever true -      </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">I love April, I love you.</span> </p> </blockquote>  <p>It is a real pleasure to be in love.
Real love is forever... I just believe in it. Who knows if it makes sense for everybody.</p></div>
