Last weekend I’ve got the <a href="http://www.prototypegame.com/" target="_blank">Prototype Game</a>. I like it a lot and the game play is very enjoying. But all that came did not come such simple. After I installed the game and tried it on me Athlon XP 64 6000+ and GeForce 6500 512 MB system I had probably about 5 FPS in the game. The system still satisfies minimum requirements.<br />
I though that my systems is already old for the game, so I upgrades CPU and graphic card to x4 Phenom 9650 and Radeon 4850 1GB graphic card. I expected at least <i>some</i> improvement in the game experience, to play the game at least a bit smoother… But the hardware upgrade did not change anything (at least visually I could not mention the difference).<br />
And this is at 640x480 resolution with everything set to minimum (though there are no many options in the game itself).<br />
I went to their forum and found that many people have performance issues with this game. And the suggestion to fix it is to <b>disable all HID devices (USB devices) except ones in use (mouse/keyboard)</b>.<br />
It is weird but it worked for me. Now I can play the game pretty smoothly at its max.<br />
I probably did not need to upgrade at all. But I like the new system :). I hardly ever need the QUAD processor at home except for gaming. The rating on my Vista is 5.9 which is neither best ever score nor worst. I have 5.9 on each item in the system. On the prev system lowest score was 5.4: HDD; 5.6 - Memory. After upgrading CPU and graphic card I got 5.9 on every item. So far so good. Waiting for the next hungry game.<br />
And one more time, I really enjoy the game… Even knowing that I don’t like so much killing and stuff like that.</div>
