<div class='post'>
The big corporations are usually very conservative and in order to change something inside the huge bureaucracy people have to go through many obstacles and justify their decisions.<br />
I wonder how ones could justify that <a href="http://www.sutor.com/c/2010/07/ibm-moving-to-firefox-as-default-browser/" target="_blank">IBM is moving to the Firefox web browser</a>. Whatever the justification is I believe it the positive decision for the word-wide-web and normal people using the web.<br />
Do the corporations still have a passion and not only the financial benefits? Maybe both: complementing each other? That would be an idealistic world.</div>
