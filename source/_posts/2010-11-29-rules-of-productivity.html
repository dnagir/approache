<p>How do we get more work done? It is a question that every manager and every passionate worker faces. Yet, for the most part, teams operate on gut instinct and habit. The results are less than optimal. [<a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/09/rules-of-productivity-presentation.html">source</a>]</p>  <h2></h2>  <h2>What is productivity?</h2>  <ul>   <li>+ Work accomplished </li>    <li>- Work required to fix defects </li>    <li>- Work required to fix bad design decisions </li> </ul>  <p>Productivity can be <strong><em>negative </em></strong>when there is more harm than good.</p>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_6a0bIbZ1HXw/TPMsQV26e9I/AAAAAAAAEx4/W_cKdhYLIEc/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_6a0bIbZ1HXw/TPMsREicCvI/AAAAAAAAEx8/UGFxiCYKKxc/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="455" height="347" /></a> </p>  <h2>&#160;</h2>  <h2>Experiment 1: Overtime</h2>  <p>Working more than&#160; 40 hours a week leads to decreased productivity.</p>  <ul>   <li>&lt; 40 hours/week – working not “enough”. </li>    <li>&gt; 60 hours/week – small productivity boost. </li> </ul>  <p>The boost only lasts for 3 to 4 weeks and then turns <em><strong>negative</strong></em>. Though can be used for a short-time productivity increase.</p>  <p>So, work 40 hours a week with time for rest and family. Never work 2 months of 60 hrs/week. Overall productivity will be lower, despite the initial boost.</p>  <h2></h2>  <h2>Experiment 2: Work harder in bursts.</h2>  <ul>   <li>Take advantage of the burst during overtime. </li>    <li>Crunch for a week and work only 40 hrs on another week. </li>    <li>Any more efficient work patterns? </li> </ul>  <p>Anything over 40 hrs/week results in a recovery period, no matter how you split it up. 40 hrs/week can be 10 hrs/day for 4 days and one day off. This pattern of work can increase productivity by 10-70%.<a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_6a0bIbZ1HXw/TPMsSG9AnZI/AAAAAAAAEyA/Wq0Ax8mVAgc/s1600-h/image%5B5%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; margin-left: 0px; border-left-width: 0px; margin-right: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_6a0bIbZ1HXw/TPMsS0R9wwI/AAAAAAAAEyE/3C1FYViAnek/image_thumb%5B3%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="468" height="357" /></a></p>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>Raise productivity immediately with short spurts &lt; 3 weeks. </li>    <li>Overtime temporarily to meet deadlines. </li>    <li>Plan for the reduction in productivity immediately afterwards. </li>    <li>Consider 4-day work week as a flexitime option. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Experiment 3:&#160; Performance for knowledge workers declines after 35 hrs, not 40.</h2>  <ul>   <li>Creativity and problem solving decreases faster with fatigue than manual labour. </li>    <li>Grinding&#160; out problems by working longer&#160; on average result in inferior solutions. </li>    <li>Lack of sleep is particularly damaging. </li> </ul>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>Overtime kills creativity. </li>    <li>If you are stuck on a problem, go home or take a break. </li>    <li>Get 8 hrs of sleep to improve your problem solving abilities. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Experiment 4: Teams on overtime feel like they are doing more, but actually accomplish less.</h2>  <ul>   <li>Team with overtime feels like they are doing much more than the team without overtime. </li>    <li>Team without overtime produces the better product and accomplishes more. </li> </ul>  <p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_6a0bIbZ1HXw/TPMsTkqVtLI/AAAAAAAAEyI/HZvCvNe_lNY/s1600-h/image%5B13%5D.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_6a0bIbZ1HXw/TPMsUp4sGLI/AAAAAAAAEyM/IHbhVUR7D-k/image_thumb%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="476" height="363" /></a> </p>  <p>Humans ignore the systematic costs and physiological biases:</p>  <ul>   <li>Failure to measure (cost of defects, bad design decisions, missed opportunities). </li>    <li>Linear extrapolation (initial productivity boost is seen as same in the future). </li>    <li>Habit (a bad one!). </li>    <li>Self reported excellence (behaviour rewarded independent of the results). </li> </ul>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>The feeling of increased long-term productivity is FALSE. </li>    <li>Use customer metrics to determine the productivity. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Experiment 5: Productivity is maximised in small teams of 4-8 people.</h2>  <ul>   <li>Productivity of a small group is 30-50% higher than groups over 10 people. </li>    <li>Too high cost of communication for groups with &gt; 10 people. </li>    <li>Smaller teams don’t have enough breadth to solve a wide array of problems. </li> </ul>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>Split your teams into cross-functional teams. </li>    <li>Link small teams using '”scrum-of-scrums”. </li>    <li>Create processes for:      <ul>       <li>growing new teams; </li>        <li>splitting large teams; </li>        <li>transitioning to new projects; </li>     </ul>   </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Experiment 6: Seat people on the same team together in a closed team room.</h2>  <ul>   <li><em><strong>100% increase </strong></em>in productivity. </li>    <li>Faster communication and problem-solving. </li>    <li>Fewer external interruptions to the team increase overall productivity. </li> </ul>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>Seat the team in their own room. With walls. </li>    <li>Give at least 5 sqr/meters per person. </li>    <li>Create side rooms for private conversations, phone calls, meetings. </li>    <li>Minimise non-team distractions. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Experiment 6: Cross-functional teams outperform siloed teams</h2>  <ul>   <li>Produced more effective solutions in the same time. </li>    <li>Much more likely to generate breakthrough solutions. </li>    <li>Short-term loss of negotiation of norms. </li> </ul>  <p>This is why:</p>  <ul>   <li>Fewer external dependencies mean fewer lengthy blockages. </li>    <li>Team has the breadth to see the forest, not just the trees. </li>    <li>Different perspectives mean lower chance of groupthink. </li> </ul>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>Create the team where every skill needed to solve the problem at hand is in the same room. </li>    <li>Limit the charter: “Do everything = big team”. </li>    <li>Fulltime: focused team member efforts. <em><strong>Multitasking = 15% drop in productivity</strong></em>. </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Experiment 8: Scheduling at 80% of team capacity produces better products.</h2>  <ul>   <li>Scheduling at 100% doesn’t give space to creativity. </li>    <li>No lost time: passionate workers keep thinking. </li>    <li>The 20% goes into new idea generation and process improvements. </li>    <li><em><strong>Producing 20 great features is usually far more profitable than 100 competent features</strong></em>. </li> </ul>  <p>Why?</p>  <ul>   <li>Allows employees to explore many options cheaply. </li>    <li>Gives time to prototype breakthrough solutions that sound crazy on paper. </li>    <li><em><strong>Allows people to pursue passions</strong></em>. </li> </ul>  <p>So:</p>  <ul>   <li>Schedule 20% below possible velocity. </li>    <li>Hold periodic reviews of side projects and award interesting ideas. </li>    <li>Publicise and reward side projects that make their way into production. </li>    <li>Keep a public list of important things if anyone runs out of work (happens rarely). </li> </ul>  <p>&#160;</p>  <h2>Other productivity Techniques</h2>  <h3>Experimentation culture:</h3>  <ul>   <li>Fail faster to find success sooner. </li>    <li>Short iterations. </li>    <li>User metrics such as A/B testing. </li>    <li>State gate portfolio management. </li> </ul>  <h3>Safety nets:</h3>  <ul>   <li>Test-Driven-Development. </li>    <li>Daily/weekly access to real customers. </li> </ul>  <h3>Empower the team</h3>  <ul>   <li>Constraints-based requirements, not mandates from above. </li>    <li>Training. </li> </ul>  <p>See the original <a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2008/09/rules-of-productivity-presentation.html">PDF</a>.</p>  </div>
