I sometimes play billiard to enjoy and have some relax. I took a cue in my hands tens times and thought I can hit balls very well, but when I played with a girls who's specialict in billiard I lost <strong>four</strong> games with zero result. Well, it was really nice to watch her play. And I also won that day one of my friends first time! Not sure how...
But now I want to have some more games and train myself. If my patience will allow that...
Russian billiard is very interesting. There're a large table, small packets and large balls.</div>

When playing billiard with girls you must be concentrated on the game, not girls. That's the reason...</div>
