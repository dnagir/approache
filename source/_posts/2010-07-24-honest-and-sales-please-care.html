I have watched the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QWHkcCP3tA">RailsConf 2010 by Gary Vaynerchuk</a> and I believe that was <b>one of the best presentations I have seen</b> in a very long while.<br />
<br />
Gary is just outstanding and I highly recommend you to watch this video it (but be prepared - there is a log of swearing, which I actually like).<br />
<br />
There is nothing about Ruby (On Rails), .NET, Java or any other technology.<br />
This is just a talk about what you <b>should care about</b> as a business owner, this is about <b>appreciation of the digital era</b> we are living in. Also it is about <b>caring</b> about people, and <b>cutting bullshit</b>.<br />
<br />
Sit, make yourself comfortable and DO WATCH it:<br />

Hope you'll enjoy it.</div>
