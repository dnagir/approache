<div class='post'>
<p>I will start a new series of posts to have more or less complete list of development tools (I often use my blog as a small notebook).</p>  <p>It will be labeled as <a href="http://dnagir.blogspot.com/search/label/DevTools">DevTools</a>.</p>  <p>I plan to post one post per &quot;tool&quot; or one post per set of similar tools.</p>  <p>Not sure how I'll go with and if I need to update posts or with every new tool create another topic.</p>  <p>I mean what should I do if I have let's say &quot;.NET Unit Testing Tools&quot; that includes NUnit, MbUnit and I found out that there's also MsTest?</p>  <p>Should I write a new post about MsTest or just update the old one?</p>  <p>Anyway, that's just a try and I'll see how I go with it...</p>  </div>

Hi Alex,<BR/>I think I will update the original post and probably add a comment on it (or just highligh the edited part somehow).<BR/><BR/>Anyway it's just an intention for now, not sure how far I'll go  with it.</div>

As for me, better idea is keep posts updated, and when update happens just post a little message with link to original guide. <BR/>That how you could keep all the reviews in one place, thus allowing for easy comparison.<BR/><BR/>And - great things. This idea seems to be awesome - having all the tools reviewed and classified.<BR/><BR/>THanks!</div>
