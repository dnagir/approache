The <a href="http://www.roboform.com/">RoboForm</a> is really a great tool.
It allows saving web forms securely. You don't have to remember and enter passwords and other details every time on the web. You just click a button and it's done.

I realized that I really cannot live without it.
I found I have more than 100 logins and notes in RoboForm.
So I backed it up one more time :-)

It's just a pleasure to use it.
You don't have to remember all your usernames (which can be different) for hundred of sites that you rarely visit.
Before RoboForm era when I visited such a site I often proceeded with a password restore process.
This is mainly because of I don't write any sensitive information on paper or store in PC's file PC. This means I often forgot it :-)

Now it's no longer the case. I never know the password, I never type, I never think what password to choose (RoboForm can generate very complex ones).
I only press a button on my toollbar.

I just love it and recommend to everybody who still doesn't use it.
