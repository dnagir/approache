I got a friendly email from a guy (I don’t know him) who was trying to promote his web site. It looked pretty new and was about sharing the developer resources.<br />
He asked me to contribute. There are plenty of similar sites.<br />
Next day I saw the guys is willing to chat with me in Gmail.<br />
I wanted to know where he found me from and then see if i can help him. Yes I am often concerned where they get the email from. In fact I had number of similar situation and everybody was happy at the end of the day (they got their promotions in one or the other way, I just got “thanks” or something more material).<br />
<br />
Here’s our short discussion. How do you like it?<br />
At the end of it I felt like I owe him something. Ridiculous. Don’t you think so?   <br />The part I like is that guys is talking how he liked my articles nut was not able to clarify that. Should I tell here what website it was about?<br />
