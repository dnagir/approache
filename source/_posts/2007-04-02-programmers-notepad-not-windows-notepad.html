How often you open Windows Notepad to view some C#, C++, XML code? And to change some lines in those file?
Are you do doing it sometimes a day at least? If yes, the tool will be helpful for you.

I <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_0">discovered</span> it some time before: <a href="http://www.pnotepad.org/">Programmer's Notepad</a>.

It is still simple and easy-weight application that has is going to help for every developer.
I recommend it as a replacement of Windows Notepad.</div>
