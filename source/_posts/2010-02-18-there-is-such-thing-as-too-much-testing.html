Have been watching the RubyConf 2009 <a href="http://rubyconf2009.confreaks.com/21-nov-2009-13-15-there-is-such-a-thing-as-too-much-testing-jake-scruggs.html" target="_blank">video</a>. And I liked the matrix which is based on 3 dimensions to determine level of testing. The questions you have to ask to determine how much testing you need should include:<br />
<ul>
<li>Did your tests stop/find bugs?      <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>How often? </li>
<li>How soon? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Was there good design?      <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Did the tests encourage good design? </li>
<li>How easy was it to write new features? </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What's the level of developer buy-in for testing? </li>
<li>What's the level of buy-in for managers? </li>
<li>What level of assurance do you need? Are you really sure? (Lose a tweet – not a big deal, lose a life – thing you're dead too). </li>
</ul>
The lessons are:<br />
<ul>
<li>Start small (do not do Selenium at least!). </li>
<li>Do not get new resources just to run your tests. They MUST be fast enough.      <br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Paralllelise. </li>
<li>Use fast machine or cloud. </li>
<li>Do not hit external resources (including DB if possible). </li>
<li>Profile and examine slow tests. </li>
<li>remove redundant tests. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Distinguish between model and integration test clearly. You often assert in model test instead of integration ones. </li>
</ul></div>
