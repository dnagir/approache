<div class='post'>
A friend of mine just sent me the link:&nbsp;<a href="http://html5readiness.com/">HTML 5 Readiness</a>.<br />
Check it out - it shows browsers support for HTML5.<br />
<br />
As always Internet Explorer is far behind. Chrome is doing very, very well.<br />
<br />
And one more link (not really related) for myself as a note: <a href="http://everytimezone.com/">visual time zone representation</a>.</div>
