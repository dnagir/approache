<div class='post'>
I spent two days for this error.
Everything works just fine in Firefox.
It doesn't in IE.

When I had found the cause of the problem I remembered how often my mom told me to be attentive.
Compare the Javascript code:<code>
var root = {
    name: "hello world",
}
</code>
with this one:<code>
var root = {
    name: "hello world"
}
</code>

See the error?
Can you imagine such a mistake in a large file?

I like JavaScript a lot, but I hate how much it is (and me) error prone.
I hope I have learned the lesson.</div>
